# **Project description**
Creating an interactive dashboard using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/); a framework created by plotly.  

Our dashboard enables the user to select one or more stocks from the dropdown. For each selected item, a line plot will be generated in the graph. By default, the dropdown menu has search functionalities, which makes the selection out of many available options an easy task.

The data used is the [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?select=cardio_train.csv) from kaggle
